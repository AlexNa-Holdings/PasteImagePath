# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately to the project maintainers with:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

Maintainers will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and work on a fix.

## Scope Notes

This app is local-first and does not include backend services. Security reports are still welcome for:
- Clipboard handling
- Temp file handling
- Privileged/macOS permission behaviors
