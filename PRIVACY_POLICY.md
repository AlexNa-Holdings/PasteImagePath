# Privacy Policy

**Paste Image Path** is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how the app handles your data.

## Data Collection

Paste Image Path does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. The app operates entirely offline on your Mac.

## What the App Does

- Reads images from your clipboard when you press the hotkey
- Saves them as temporary PNG files in your Mac's local temp directory
- Copies the file path to your clipboard
- Automatically deletes temporary files older than 24 hours

## Network Access

The app makes **zero** network connections. No data is ever sent to any server, third party, or analytics service.

## Permissions

- **Accessibility**: Required to simulate the paste keystroke (Cmd+V). This permission is granted by you in System Settings and can be revoked at any time.

## Third-Party Services

The app uses no third-party SDKs, analytics, crash reporting, or tracking tools.

## Data Storage

All data (temporary image files and preferences) is stored locally on your Mac. No cloud storage is used.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the changes will be posted here. Since the app collects no data, significant changes are unlikely.
